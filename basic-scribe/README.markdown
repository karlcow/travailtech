# Basic Minutes generator

A script I wrote to handle basic minutes text written into a web form, parse, format, and send to a CMS. 
Written in 2010, somewhat cleaned up and made public for your enjoyment. It might even still work.

This script includes:

* A parser for basic, text based minutes, including agenda, actions, resolutions
* A few unit tests for the parser
* An HTML-form driven input (so the script can run as CGI)
* HTML templates for minutes output
* HTML output for preview and POST of the final results to, say, a wiki or blog page

Enjoy,
