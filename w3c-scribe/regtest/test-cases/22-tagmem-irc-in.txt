18:11:44 <DanC> Topic: Change location of June f2f? (Edinburgh?)
18:12:13 <DanC> VQ: recall we agreed to meet near Nice just after the W3C AC meeting, but it's no longer convenient for Chris...
18:12:26 <DanC> ... and HT has offered to host...
18:12:33 <DanC> ... some preferences each way...
18:12:36 <Roy> Edinburgh +1
18:12:42 <noah> France +1
18:12:53 <noah> (if someone will host, of course)
18:13:14 <DanC> Chris: I have not told Coralie (prospective INRIA local organizer) to cancel our meeting in June
18:13:17 <noah> Edinburgh OK if not, just trying to save travel wear n tear
18:13:24 <DanC> VQ: to expects to attend the AC meeting?
18:13:28 <DanC> DC: I do
18:13:30 <DanC> DO: I do
18:13:32 <noah> NM: I do
18:13:33 <DanC> HT: I do
18:13:59 <DanC> NDW: I prefer Edingburgh, though that reduces the chance I'll attend the AC meeting
18:14:05 <Ed> I will not be at the AC meeting
18:14:05 <DanC> VQ: I expect TimBL to attend the AC meeting
18:14:29 <DanC> Roy: I think timbl had a conflict with the June 8 Date

18:17:09 <DanC> HT: I think I can hold my hosting reservations for a month without much cost in case I cancel
18:17:46 <DanC> VQ: so let's take another week to consider it
18:18:02 <DanC> ACTION VQ: contact Coralie re 8-10 June meeting arrangements at INRIA.
18:18:18 <DanC> CL: you might ask her about Cannes vs Sophia while you're at it

18:20:45 <DanC> VQ: some is more than admin... issues list maintenance
18:21:33 <Chris> start discussing issue list stuff in email to get up to speed?

18:28:33 <DanC> -> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Feb/0015.html Norm's request
18:29:11 <DanC> (hmm... seems to fall under versioning41, but so does all of life, the universe, and everything, so maybe a specific issue is good)

18:30:06 <Zakim> ok, Chris-again; the call is being made
18:30:07 <Zakim> +Chris
18:30:33 <DanC> DC: issue name ideas?
18:30:47 <DanC> NDW: nameSpaceTerms-NN, maybe?
18:31:04 <Roy> nameAdditions-NN ?
18:31:16 <Chris-again> reservedNoReally?
18:32:13 <DanC> NDW: some urgency motivates a separate issue from versioning41: having a TAG decision before end of xml:id CR period would be nice
18:32:14 <Vincent> ack DanC
18:32:14 <Zakim> DanC, you wanted to ask about timing expectations
18:33:32 <Roy> digestable +1
18:34:12 <DanC> DO: so the results of this new issue could be folded into work on versioning41?
18:34:15 <Zakim> +[Microsoft]
18:34:24 <DanC> NDW: sure, but this seems independent of schema languages etc. [?]
18:34:45 <paulc> paulc has joined #tagmem
18:34:47 <DanC> HT: people often read more into the namespace REC than is there; I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify
18:35:04 <DanC> Zakim, [Microsoft] is PaulC
18:35:04 <Zakim> +PaulC; got it
18:35:33 <Norm> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Feb/0015.html
18:35:38 <Norm> That's the URI paulc 
18:35:46 <RRSAgent> See http://www.w3.org/2005/02/22-tagmem-irc#T18-35-38
18:36:45 <DanC> DO: one thing that's in the [draft] finding now is a discussion of relationship between terms, [missed?], which seems relevant
18:38:21 <DanC> RF: [good point about issues : findings. can't summarize real-time]. I suggest "nameAddition" because the identity questions don't seem to be the main thing
18:38:36 <ht> q+ to disagree with Norm
18:38:55 <DanC> NDW: ...[missed?]... crux of it is xml: namespace [?]
18:39:10 <Chris-again> ... and is it bounded or not
18:39:27 <DanC> CL: yes, that is the main thing... one spec made an assuption about the xml: namespace, and unless "will not change" is explicitly stated, that's not safe
18:39:36 <Vincent> ack ht
18:39:36 <Zakim> ht, you wanted to disagree with Norm
18:39:44 <DanC> [scribe gives up trying to keep up]
18:40:15 <Roy> We can have one finding answer multiple issues, but tracking multiple issues under a single issue name simply because we expect them to be answered in one finding would be a mistake, IMO.
18:40:24 <DanC> HT: to speak of "adding names to a namespace" doesn't make sense. the names are all there.
18:40:36 <DanC> NDW: while I might agree, that's not universally agreed
18:40:55 <noah> +1, I agree with Henry. At the very least, we shouldn't preclude in advance that possible formulation
18:40:56 <Chris-again> HT: namespace is a set, unbounded, all names already exist in it
18:41:16 <dorchard> The first part of the finding has an attempt at formal description of the architecture of languages http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2004Nov/att-0071/versioning-part1.html
18:41:45 <noah> If you're looking for a name for an issue (I can't quite tell), how about "immutableNamespaces"?
18:42:38 <ht> namespaceState?
18:42:44 <DanC> +1 namespaceState
18:43:06 <Ed> +1 namespaceState
18:43:51 <DanC> VQ: seems we're agreed (agreeing?) to add an issue, in addition to, while perhaps related to, issue 41
18:44:17 <Chris-again> +1 namespaceState
18:44:31 <Roy> +1 namespaceState
18:44:40 <dorchard> +1 namespaceState
18:44:53 <Norm> +1 namespaceState
18:45:01 <DanC> RESOLVED: to accept issue namespaceState.
18:47:05 <Chris-again> q+ to add that a cc should be sent to affected WGs
18:47:30 <DanC> PC: we need to announce the issue to tag-announce
18:47:52 <DanC> VQ: ndw's request serves as an issue summary?
18:47:55 <DanC> Ed: OK
18:48:01 <Roy> +1

18:51:28 <Chris-again> ack Chris
18:51:28 <Zakim> Chris-again, you wanted to add that a cc should be sent to affected WGs
18:52:06 <ht> HST has in mind to try to summarise, in a way the owners would acknowledge as fair, the various positions so far articulated at the base of the ongoing discussion
18:52:19 <DanC> tx for the sketch, ht. pls do
18:52:30 <DanC> (not in this meeting, I assume)
18:52:37 <ht> Correct DanC
18:52:46 <DanC> PC: add this to the 3 Mar TAG/XML Core agenda?
18:52:50 <DanC> NDW: yes, quite
18:53:05 <DanC> PC: pending XML Core work depends on this?
18:53:09 <DanC> NDW: xml:id CR exit
18:53:57 <DanC> PC: is there room for this on the TAG/XML Core agenda?
18:54:01 <DanC> NDW/VQ: think so, yes

18:54:53 <DanC> Topic: New Issue?: Relationship of URI schemes to protocols
18:54:57 <Roy> my input is already in www-tag
18:55:06 <DanC> -> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Feb/0013.html Noah's request
18:55:31 <DanC> (re which, Roy?)
18:55:41 <Roy> previous topic
18:56:11 <noah> Does it make any sense to delay consideration of my request until I am there to discuss, or is the intent fairly clear from the note?
18:56:54 <DanC> DC suggests straw poll; if we can say "yes" today, very well. if not, let's wait 'till noah can make his case
18:56:59 <noah> I suppose that, selfishly, I'd be glad if you accept the issue now without me, but if you're inclined to drop it I might welcome a chance to defend it a bit, if that's not too disruptive.
18:57:43 <DanC> RF: having trouble differentiating this from work going on in uri mailing list
18:57:50 <DanC> DC: why do you want/need to differentiate?
18:57:54 <DanC> RF: good question...
18:58:19 <DanC> RF: 0013 doesn't [do it for me].
18:58:29 <DanC> DC: let's wait 'till Noah can make his case.
18:58:31 <DanC> VQ: very well.
18:58:56 <DanC> Topic: Run through Open Issues list looking for progress
18:59:04 <noah> Roy, either in these minutes or by email, maybe you could send URIs to pertinent thread in URI list?  Thanks.
18:59:07 <DanC> -> http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html?view=normal&closed=1 issues list

19:00:05 <DanC> VQ: continuing from 7 Feb, when we got to xmlFunctions-34 ...
19:00:24 <DanC> VQ: I'm interested in names relevant to each issue.
19:00:29 <Roy> Noah, there is ongoing discussion on uri@w3.org regarding rfc2717-2718 replacement that contains instructions on what to include in scheme spec.

19:07:35 <DanC> ... something like: next time a /robots.txt situation comes around, I'd like to have something in place that's better than a hard-coded name
19:07:52 <DanC> CL: meanwhile, /robots.txt is quite useful.
19:08:30 <DanC> VQ: any takers?
19:08:36 <DanC> NDW: some interest, but not much bandwidth
19:08:51 <DanC> DC: haven't have a "lightbulb" idea. prefer to leave it in the "someday" pile
19:09:00 <DanC> Topic: issue review. abstractComponentRefs-37
19:09:22 <DanC> DO: this came from a request from the web services description WG...
19:09:55 <DanC> ... (1) when we come up with a component designator, is it designating an abstract component, or a piece of syntax in the WSDL doc?
19:10:03 <DanC> ... (2) [missed?]
