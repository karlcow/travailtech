14:37 <ericP> ACTION KC, AFS, EP: publish usecases 1.148 + revision to 2.18 by KC, reviewed by AFS, plus editorial fixups by KC, ok'd by EricP
14:37 <ericP> DONE: http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20050325/ and http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases is back to editor's draft status 1.158

14:38 <DanC> Zakim, next agendum
14:38 <Zakim> agendum 3. "issue: sort" taken up [from DanC]
14:39 <ericP> ACTION Kendall: To rewrite 2.18: change the title, don't motivate "update", spell "WSDL" correctly. :>
14:39 <ericP> DONE: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases 1.149
14:39  * RRSAgent records action 8
14:39 <DanC> action -8
14:39  * RRSAgent drops action 8, Kendall to To rewrite 2.18: change the title, don't motivate "update", spell "WSDL" correctly. :>
14:40 <ericP> ACTION PatH: review sort design in 2 weeks
14:40  * RRSAgent records action 9
14:40 <DanC> 1.278 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/rq23/
14:40 <ericP> andy believes he has reached a quiescient (SP?) state
14:41 <ericP> ACTION Kevin: review sort design at earliest convenience
14:41 <ericP> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2005JanMar/0483.html
14:41  * RRSAgent records action 10
14:41 <Yoshio> quiescent
14:42 <AndyS> Google :: define:quiescent => "refers to a state of resting, inactivity or latency"
14:43 <AndyS> Also "A volcano, which is not active, but is still registering seismic activity." :-)
14:43 <thompsonbry> How could we extend from lexical comparison to achieve value comparison in a subsequent design?
14:44 <ericP> Kevin: I pointed out a few issues (consistency with distinct and a few others)
14:44 <ericP> ... Thought the interest was in ORDER BY and LIMIT, which is doable with LEXICAL sort
14:45 <ericP> Andy, lexical ordering doesn't neccesarily give you total ordering
14:46 <ericP> Kevin: we could have a future syntax for value ordering
14:47 <Yoshio> I think the problem is that data could be gathered from various sources, where the data type are different
14:47 <ericP> Andy: my pref is to go with value ordering (what people expect)
14:47 <ericP> ... we can do lexical sort with str(?foo)
14:49 <DanC> Zakim, next agendum
14:49 <Zakim> agendum 4. "issue: valueTesting" taken up [from DanC]
14:49 <thompsonbry> Andy, how does typing interact with functions to specify how a value sort will be applied?
14:49 <ericP> DanC: we can also postpoine... no takers.
14:49 <ericP> ACTION EricP: to propose to close valueTesting (bonus points for test cases, to EricP or others)
14:49  * RRSAgent records action 11
14:50 <AndyS> See doc : can write "ORDER BY x:func(?x)" as a (partial) ordering 
14:50 <ericP> CONTINUED. expect to meet end of month deadline
14:50 <ericP> action -10
14:50  * RRSAgent drops action 10, Kevin to review sort design at earliest convenience
14:52 <AndyS> q+ to ask about !=
14:52  * Zakim sees AndyS on the speaker queue
14:52 <DanC> ack andys
14:52 <Zakim> AndyS, you wanted to ask about !=
14:52  * Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
14:54 <DanC> (I suspect "error" is misleading terminology... "unkown" might communicate the notion better)
14:54 <Yoshio> q+ to ask if this applies to cases where there is no data for deciding the equality
14:54  * Zakim sees Yoshio on the speaker queue
14:55 <ericP> EricP: how do people feel about requiring explicity casts where XQuery would not require them?
14:55 <ericP> [ no probs with it ]
14:56 <ericP> #invocation
14:56 <ericP> #StandardOperations
14:57  * DanC q+ to ask if the "x"^^mytype != "y"^^mytpe test is in the test suite, and ask for a volunteer if not
14:57  * Zakim sees Yoshio, DanC on the speaker queue
14:59  * DanC q+ about compliance and unknown datatypes
14:59  * Zakim DanC, you typed too many words without commas; I suspect you forgot to start with 'to ...'
14:59 <DanC> ack yoshio
14:59 <Zakim> Yoshio, you wanted to ask if this applies to cases where there is no data for deciding the equality
14:59  * Zakim sees DanC on the speaker queue
14:59  * DanC q+ to reiterate suggestion about compliance and unknown datatypes
14:59  * Zakim sees DanC on the speaker queue
15:00  * Yoshio typing in IRC would help me a lot
15:00  * Yoshio please
15:01 <ericP> Yoshio: how about unknown equiv in sorting?
15:02 <ericP> PatH: how about we don't define it so folks don't rely on it.
15:02 <Yoshio> me: even if they are of the same data type
15:02 <ericP> tx
15:03 <DanC> ack danc
15:03 <Zakim> DanC, you wanted to ask if the "x"^^mytype != "y"^^mytpe test is in the test suite, and ask for a volunteer if not and to reiterate suggestion about compliance and unknown
15:03 <Zakim> ... datatypes
15:03  * Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
15:03 <ericP> AndyS: in SQL world, people do rely on the ordering and causes trouble
15:04 <DanC> ACTION AndyS: propose a test re "x"^^mytype != "y"^^mytpe
15:04  * RRSAgent records action 12
15:05  * AndyS persuaded by arg for stable, non-determinate ordering so processors that know more datatypes, do better.
15:09 <DanC> Zakim, next agendum
15:09 <Zakim> agendum 5. "SPARQL QL LC Candidate" taken up [from DanC]
15:09 <ericP> ACTION AndyS: to clarify 5.4 w/r/t closed world assumption

15:11 <ericP> ACTION AndyS: to explain how to get a whole graph with CONSTRUCT * and GRAPH.
15:11  * RRSAgent records action 14
15:11 <kendall> long conversation sorta put me off attending to it carefully, sorry :>
15:12 <AndyS> It's not CONSTRUCT * but there is "Accessing Graphs in the RDF Dataset"
15:13 <DanC> "Accessing Graphs in the RDF Dataset" -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/rq23/#construct
15:13 <ericP> DONE , above pointer
15:13 <ericP> action -14
15:13  * RRSAgent drops action 14, AndyS to to explain how to get a whole graph with CONSTRUCT * and GRAPH.
15:14 <kendall> (hmm, another reason for a getGraph in the protocol is for implementations taht don't support construct at all.)
15:14 <ericP> ACTION DaveB: consider dots in qnames, report on impact on turtle
15:14  * RRSAgent records action 15
15:16 <ericP> AndyS: won't get rid of all the todos by thur.
15:16 <ericP> ... which way do you want it?
15:18 <kendall> it's by-invitation only, so Eric's trying to be respectful of that. :>
15:18 <kendall> it was scheduled a long time ago, btw
15:19 <thompsonbry> Dan, since Andy will be pulling hair for the 31st, why don't we just back the candidate for review by another week - especially since we have one meeting canceled.
15:20 <ericP> regrets 2 week hence: EricP, DaveB, SteveH
15:20 <ericP> plus, AndyS, if i recall his vacation schedule
15:22  * AndyS back by April 12 - maybe be swapped in by then, may not

15:25 <SimonR> I'm sneaky.  ;)
15:26 <DanC> Kendall expects Bijan to review it

15:40 <Zakim> On the phone I see Kevin, AndyS, Yoshio, DanC, BryanT, EricP, Kendall_Clark, PatH, JanneS
15:40 <thompsonbry> Do we have a mapping of these interfaces onto the use cases?
15:41 <ericP> AndyS: interested in 3. don't know how datasets work in this proposal
15:41 <kendall> ooh, yoshio makes a good point. thanks. have a mispelling.
15:41 <ericP> Kevin: nothign to say, not at boston
15:41 <ericP> Yoshio: nothing to say
15:41 <ericP> DanC: in favor of 3
15:42 <ericP> BryanT: want to interface to create and drop graphs
15:42 <ericP> EricP: 3
15:42 <ericP> KendallC: pass
15:42 <ericP> PatH: pass
15:43 <ericP> Janne: originally wanted lots of primitives. now want minimal set. 3.
15:44 <ericP> KendallC: (unpassing) i remember 3 getting the most support in BOS. Graph retrieval has support to go to its own interface.

15:52 <ericP> notes at risk
15:53 <DanC> # SPARQL Abstract Syntax Seaborne, Andy (Monday, 21 March)  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2005JanMar/0393.html
15:54 <DanC> sparqlx.rnc 1.6 makes sense to me, i think
15:57 <ericP> KendallC: wasn't going to invest much work if it was not likely to gain support
15:57 <ericP> PatH: what are the design goals of the XML serialization?
15:58 <ericP> DanC: making two contrete syntaxes makes the abstract syntax clear
15:59 <ericP> ... in web services, the input in defined by XS datatypes.
15:59 <AndyS> <> rdfs:seeAlso http://www.w3.org/TR/xqueryx/
16:00 <ericP> [plus, i keep getting hints that my connectivity is at risk]
16:00 <AndyS> FWIW I didn't make the abstract syntax obvious because there was only one concrete syntax 
16:00 <ericP> BryanT: how coupled is the human syntax to the X-syntax
16:00 <kendall> oh, also, another design goal is to not worry overly about being able to roundtrip from surface syntax to xml and back -- hence, no PREFIX in the XML.
16:01 <ericP> Andy: change from RDQL to N3 syntax did not impact the abstract syntax
16:02 <ericP> [missing all voice now]
16:02 <ericP> can i get a substitute scribe?
16:02 <DanC> ACTION KendallC: work out remaining details in sparqlx.{rnc,xsd,rng}: expression syntax, order-by stuff
